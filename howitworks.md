## There are three basic steps to getting your work professionally proofread or edited
<br/>
### Step 1: Decide what level of editing or proofreading you require
<br/>
#### Light edit or proofread

You feel that your text is fine as it is and simply need someone to lightly check for formatting errors, such as missing commas, incorrect punctuation, and spelling. For you, a light copyedit or simple proofread is what you are looking for! 

This is usually a faster process, as I don't focus too much attention on resolving syntax errors or issues of style or consistency. Rather, I make sure the nuts and bolts of your writing are solid and screwed in tight! 

As a result, this option is perfect for confident or experienced writers, or those on a tight deadline.

#### Medium edit

Are you worried that you have used too many (or not enough!) commas? Are you in the habit of writing long-winded sentences that are often constructed in the passive voice? It could be that this is your first thesis or article in English, or you are determined to make this one sound really **good**. 

You'll probably be interested in a medium-level edit. 

With this option I work with you to enhance the strengths of your writing. As well as working on the nuts and bolts of your punctuation, grammar, and spelling, I also highlight stylistic areas which you could improve on, offer alternatives, and explain the reasoning behind them. This option is perfect for those who are in the writing process, have a little more time, and are looking for someone they can depend on to help them produce a quality piece of writing.

#### Deep edit

Perhaps you find that you are spending a lot of time google translating large chunks of your thesis or dissertation into English, or you are too focused on the actual writing to take refresher English writing courses. You might feel that your writing requires a massive overhaul or maybe you are simply after strong, consistent writing advice. 

These are areas in which I can be of great assistance. 

A deep edit takes more time to accomplish, as every sentence needs to be evaluated; however, the benefits of investing in such a process can be huge! At this level, as well as looking at the usual suspects of grammar, punctuation and spelling, I ensure that your finished product is consistent in structure, tone, voice, and style.

#### Unsure?

If you are unsure what level you need, then no problem! Send me a sample of your writing (step 2) and I can give you feedback .

### Step 2: Select a sample

#### Choosing the sample

Everyone's writing is different. As such, to give you an accurate estimate of the predicted time and cost of the assignment, I need to be able to read some of your writing. Generally, between 6-10 pages is a good amount, ideally in .doc format. Don't worry, this is completely confidential!

#### What do I do with the sample?

After I receive the sample, with your specific requirements in mind, I work through it for one hour, making the required alterations and adding comments where things are not clear. After the hour is up, I send back the edited document for you to evaluate and state my estimate for the entire project, based on your requirements.

### Step 3: Choose an option

#### It's your choice

Once you have received the edited document it's your turn to evaluate my work. At this point I am available for any questions you might have. If my treatment of your writing suits your needs, then we are ready to get to work. Let's do this!

### The Process

While we are working on your writing you can contact me any time. If you prefer to talk face to face I offer three free face-to-face consultations via Skype or Zoom. If after the edit you have specific questions regarding sentences or paragraphs, no problem! I'll take a look at them too! My focus is to make sure you are satisfied with the finished product.
